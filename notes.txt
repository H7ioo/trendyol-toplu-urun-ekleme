TODO: Choice between Hepsiburada and Trendyol. Instead of exporting 2 variables, 1 for trendyol and another for hepsiburada we just have config file. If we choose hepsiburada it will get hepsiburada's variables. The problem is that it's not consistent. Hepsiburada has more variables, but we can just not use it.
